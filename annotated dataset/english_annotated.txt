in other countries it is the state and the employment agencies which play the main role
i would have criticized the commissionmuch more if i had not heard your speech
the joint debate is closed

so commissioner the european works council has made a significant contribution towards the further resolution of this problem
one would hope that the other fourteen member states will give us their responses just as quickly
the countries that did support a resolution against china denmark and the netherlands have been punished with economic sanctions
instead it has become a bureaucratic monster which is wrecking our economy
this is not an option
certainly insufficient funding is also an important problem

so i commend my colleague mrs lulling for a wonderful initiative and i wish it well
this watered down version of reach shows how things should not be done
what can we do
of course in this context we recognise other models
we therefore applaud mrs breyer„¢s amendment urging the commission also to draw up a legislative proposal of this nature
madam president i welcome what the previous speaker our colleague from the netherlands has just said
older people must have opportunities to participate actively in social life
the funding for this fiveyear period 20092014 has more than doubled the funds available for the previous period

the next item is voting time
all that will be forwarded to the relevant office of the house

the finnish presidency shares this view fully
wonderful
